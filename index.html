      <h3>Food Security:</h3>
      <p>Food security for a household means access by all members at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. Food security includes at a minimum:
        <br>
        - The ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods.
        <br>
        - Assured ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways (that is, without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>How is Food Security Measured?</h3>
      <p>USDA's food security statistics are based on a national food security survey conducted as an annual supplement to the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS).
      In December of each year, after completing the labor force interview, about 40,000 households respond to the food security questionsâ€”and to questions about food spending and about the use of Federal and community food assistance programs. The households interviewed in the CPS are selected to be representative of all civilian households at State and national levels.</p>
